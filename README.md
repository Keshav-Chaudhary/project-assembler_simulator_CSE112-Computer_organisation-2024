# RISC Assembler and Simulator
### CSE112 - Computer Organisation - Course Project

## Introduction

This project is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) assembler and simulator implemented in Python 3. The assembler component translates RISC instructions into their corresponding binary representation, while the simulator reverses this process by executing the binary instructions and maintaining the system's state.

## Features

### Assembler

The assembler takes human-readable RISC assembly code and converts it into machine-readable binary code. It supports a variety of RISC instructions and generates the corresponding binary output that can be executed by the simulator.
